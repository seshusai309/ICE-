SUITS IN Case of Emergency Card (ICE) Project :

Welcome to the SUITS IN Case of Emergency Card (ICE) project! This project aims to provide 
individuals with a vital tool to overcome the challenges faced during medical or trauma 
emergencies. The ICE card is designed to ensure that crucial information about the victim 
is readily available, enabling prompt and effective care during the critical Golden Hour.


About the Project :
The SUITS IN ICE project focuses on developing and promoting the use of ICE cards to bridge 
the gap between emergency responders and individuals in need. By enrolling in this project, 
you gain access to a comprehensive range of services and resources aimed at enhancing your 
emergency preparedness and overall safety.

ICE Card Enrollment: 
                  By enrolling in the project, you can obtain your very own SUITS IN ICE card. 
                  This card will contain essential information such as your name, address, 
                  blood group, medical conditions, and contact details of your emergency contacts.
